# UT Full-Stack Bootcamp Module 2 Challenge: Professional Portfolio Mockup

## Main Objective
This module's challenge focuses on the student's knowledge on advanced CSS styling, and how it can be used to create responsive and visually pleasing content for a webpage. By designing a mockup of a full-stack developer's portfolio page, I am able to showcase both my skills as a designer, as well as use those skills to present previous works done in a easily digestable way.
